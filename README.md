# Welcome to the NDS Workshop

This is a bare repo intended for usage in a workshop hosted by Per and Mattias for NDS.

This is a simple `vite` setup with React and Typescript.
To run this repo run the following commands:
```bash
  npm i
  npm run dev
```

Your task is to try and replicate something similar to this [figma](https://www.figma.com/file/hnudYJOqPU8RAneNWnGkvS/NDS-Workshop?type=design&node-id=1-213&mode=design&t=7axJOqN5g9L9ZdNu-0).
This is inspiration to you and showcases the components we have today, but feel free to be as creative as you like.

But first you need to install the `@netlight-design-system/nds-react`.
Head over to our [Storybook](https://nds.edgez.live/?path=/docs/doc-about-nds--docs) and get started.
We have already installed the **Netlight font** ([Proxima Nova](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/proxima-nova)), which mean you don't have to install it yourself.


### Why this workshop?
Today, we have a collaboration with Feedback Tool, and they are giving us great feedback, but we want MORE!
We have a [form](https://forms.office.com/e/ugD0iqHTjx) we want you to fill out by the end of the workshop but feel free to reach out to Per or Mattias for some faster feedback.
